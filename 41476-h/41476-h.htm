<h3>
<span>A FEW THINGS ABOUT RICHARD BAXTER.</span>
</h3>



<p>In the year 1836, I visited Kidderminster for the purpose of seeing the
place where Richard Baxter spent fourteen of the most valuable years of
his life; and of ascertaining if any relics were to be found connected
with the history of this remarkable man. Baxter thought much of
Kidderminster, for with strong feeling he says, respecting this place,
in his poem on "Love breathing Thanks and Praise" (<cite>Poetical Fragments</cite>,
1st edit. 1681):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "But among all, none did so much abound,</p>
      <p>With fruitful mercies, as that barren ground,</p>
     <p> Where I did make my best and longest stay,</p>
      <p>And bore the heat and burden of the day;</p>
     <p> Mercies grew thicker there than summer flowers:</p>
      <p>They over-numbered my daies and hours.</p>
     <p> There was my dearest flock, and special charge,</p>
     <p> Our hearts in mutual love thou didst enlarge:</p>
      <p>'Twas there that mercy did my labours bless,</p>
     <p> With the most great and wonderful success."</p>

</div>


<p>While prosecuting my inquiries, I was shown the house in which he is
said to have resided. It is situated in the High Street, and was, at the
time of my visit, inhabited by a grocer; but I had my doubts, from a
difference of opinion I heard stated as to this being the actual house.
After looking at this house, I visited the vestry of the Unitarian
Chapel, and examined the pulpit; the description of which given by your
correspondent is very correct. He omits to mention Job Orton's chair,
which was shown me, as well as that of Bishop Hall. From all I could
learn at the time, and since, I should say that there is not the
slightest probability of any engraving having been published of this
pulpit. Sketches may have been made by private hands, but nothing I
believe in this way has ever been given to the public. I have long taken
a deep interest in everything, pertaining to Richard Baxter. I some
years ago collected ninety-seven out of the one hundred and sixty-eight
works which he wrote, most of them the original editions, and
principally on controversial subjects. After they had served the purpose
for which I purchased them, I parted with<a id="Page_482"></a> <span class="pagenum">[482]</span> them, reserving to
myself the first editions of the choicest of his practical writings. The
folio edition of his works contains only his practical treatises. One of
the most remarkable facts connected with the history of Baxter, is the
prodigious amount of mechanical drudgery to which he must have patiently
submitted in the production of his varied publications. He had a very
delicate frame: he was continually unwell, and often greatly afflicted.
To this constant ailment of body he refers in a very affecting note in
his <cite>Paraphrase on the New Testament</cite> under the fifth verse in the fifth
chapter of the Gospel of St. John. The reference is to the impotent man
at the pool of Bethesda, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</p>


 <p class="blockquot">  <em>Note.</em> "How great a mercy is it, to live eight and thirty years
   under God's wholesome discipline? How inexcusable was this man,
   if he had been proud, or worldly, or careless of his everlasting
   state? O my God! I thank thee for the like discipline of eight
   and fifty years. How safe a life is this, in comparison of full
   prosperity and pleasure."</p>


<p>His ministerial duties were of an arduous nature, and yet he found time
to write largely on theological subjects, and to plunge perpetually into
theological controversy. The <cite>Saint's Rest</cite>, by which his fame will ever
be perpetuated, was published in 1619, 4to. It is in four parts, and
dedicated respectively to the inhabitants of Kidderminster, Bridgenorth,
Coventry, and Shrewsbury. It was the first book he wrote, and the second
he published (<cite>The Aphorisms of Justification</cite> being the first
published): it was written under the daily expectation of dying. The
names of Brook, Hampden, and Pym, which have a place in the first
edition, are, singularly enough, omitted in the later ones. Fifty years
after the appearance of the <cite>Saint's Rest</cite>, and a few months only before
his death, he published the strangest of all his productions; it is&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "The Certainty of the World of Spirits, fully evinced by
   unquestionable Histories of Apparitions and Witchcrafts,
   Operations, Voices, &amp;c. Proving the Immortality of Souls, the
   Malice and Misery of Devils and the Damned, and the Blessedness
   of the Justified. Written for the Conviction of Sadducees and
   Infidels."</p>

    <p class="author1"> 12mo. 1691.</p>

<p>His <cite>Reliquiæ Baxterianæ</cite>, folio, 1686, is the text-book for the actual
every-day life of this eminent divine.</p>

<h3>
<span>LATIN SONG BY ANDREW BOORDE.</span>
</h3>


<p>The life of this "progenitor of Merry Andrew," as he is termed, would,
if minutely examined, doubtless prove a curious piece of biography. Wood
furnishes many particulars, but some of his statements want
confirmation. He tells us that Boorde was borne at Pevensey in Sussex;
but Hearne corrects him, and says it was at Bounds Hill in the same
county. It then becomes a question whether he was educated at Winchester
school. Certain it is that he was of Oxford, although he left without
taking a degree, and became a brother of the Carthusian order in London.
We next find him studying physic in his old university, and subsequently
travelling through most parts of Europe, and even of Africa. On his
return to England, he settled at Winchester, and practised as a
physician. Afterwards we find him in London occupying a tenement in the
parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. This appears to have been the period
when, in his professional capacity, King Henry VIII. is said to have
consulted him. How long he remained in London is uncertain, but in 1541
he was living at Montpelier in France, where he is supposed to have
taken the degree of doctor in physic, in which he was afterwards
incorporated at Oxford. He subsequently lived at Pevensey, and again at
Winchester. At last we find him a prisoner in the Fleet&mdash;the cause has
yet to be learned,&mdash;at which place he died in April, 1549. The following
curious relic is transcribed from the flyleaf of a copy of <cite>The Breviary
of Health</cite>, 4to., London, 1547. It is signed "Andrew Boord," and if not
the handwriting of the facetious author himself, is certainly that of
some one of his cotemporaries:</p>

to him, as well as <cite>A Right Pleasant and Merry History of the Mylner of

<p>The origin of the <cite>Merry Tales</cite> is pointed out by Horsfield, in his
<cite>History of Lewes</cite>, vol. i. p. 239.:&mdash;</p>

<p>   "At a <em>last</em>, holden at Pevensey, Oct. 3, 24 Hen. VIII., for the
   purpose of preventing unauthorised persons 'from setting nettes,
   pottes, or innyances,' or anywise taking fish within the
   privileges of the Marsh of Pevensey, the king's commission was
   directed to John, Prior of Lewes; Richard, Abbot of Begham; John,
   Prior of Mychillym; Thomas, Lord Dacre, and others ... Dr. Boorde
   (the original Merry Andrew) founds his tale of the 'Wise Men of
   Gotham' upon the proceedings of this meeting, Gotham being the
   property of Lord Dacre, and near his residence."</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Gotham in Nottinghamshire have hitherto been
considered the "biggest fools in christendom;" but if the above extract
is to be depended upon, the <em>Gothamites</em> of Sussex have a fair claim to
a share of this honourable distinction.</p>

<p>The quotation from the <cite>History of Lewes</cite> was first pointed out by your
learned correspondent, M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M. A. L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWER</span>, in a communication to Mr.
Halliwell's <cite>Archæologist</cite>, 1842, p. 129. The investigation of the
origin of this popular collection of old <em>Joe Millerisms</em> is of some
importance, because upon them rests Dr. Boorde's title to be the
"progenitor of Merry Andrew."</p>

<h3>
<span>SHAKSPEARE NOTES.</span>
</h3>

<p>Who was the editor of <cite>The Poems and Plays of William Shakspeare</cite>, eight
vols. 8vo., published by Scott and Webster in 1833?</p>

<p>In that edition the following passage from <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>, Act
III. Sc. 2., is <em>pointed</em> in this way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</p>
     <p> To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</p>
      <p>Veiling an Indian; beauty's, in a word,</p>
      <p>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</p>
    <p>  To entrap the wisest."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">To which the anonymous editor appends the following note:&mdash;</p>

<p>   "I have deviated slightly from the folio&mdash;the ordinary reading
   represents ornament as '<em>the beauteous scarf veiling an Indian
   beauty</em>,' a sentence which by no means serves to illustrate the
   reflexion which Bassanio wishes to enforce. Sir Thomas Hanmer
   proposed to read <em>dowdy</em> for beauty!"</p>


<p>My object in this quotation is not that of commending the emendation,
but of affording an opportunity of recording the following reasons which
induce me to reject it; not only as no improvement to the sense, but as
a positive injury to it.</p>

<p>1st. The argument of Bassanio is directed against the deceptiveness of
ornament in general, of which seeming beauty is only one of the
subordinate illustrations. These illustrations are drawn from <em>law</em>,
<em>religion</em>, <em>valour</em>, and <em>beauty</em>; all of which are finally summed up
in the passage in question, beginning "<em>Thus ornament</em>," &amp;c. and still
further concentrated in the phrase "<em>in a word</em>." Therefore this summing
up cannot refer singly to <em>beauty</em>, no more than to any other of the
subordinate illustrations, but it must have general reference to
adventitious ornament, against which <em>the collected argument</em> is
directed.</p>

<p>2ndly. The word <em>beauty</em> is necessarily attached to Indian as
designative <em>of sex</em>: "an Indian," unqualified by any other distinction,
would imply a male; but an "Indian beauty" is at once understood to be a
female.</p>

<p>3rdly. The repetition, or rather <em>the opposition</em>, of "<em>beauteous</em>" and
"<em>beauty</em>," cannot seriously be objected to by any one conversant with
the phraseology of Shakspeare. Were it at all necessary, many similar
examples might be cited. How the anonymous annotator, already quoted,
could say that the sentence, as it stands in the folio, "<em>by no means
serves to illustrate Bassanio's reflexion</em>," I cannot conceive. "The
beauteous scarf" is the deceptive ornament which leads to the
expectation of something beneath it <em>better</em> than an <em>Indian</em> beauty!
Indian is used adjectively, in the sense of wild, savage, hideous&mdash;just
as we, at the present day, might say a Hottentot beauty; or as
Shakspeare himself in other places uses the word "Ethiop:"</p>


<div class="poem">

      <p>"Thou for whom Jove would swear</p>
     <p> Juno but an Ethiop were."<a id="Page_484"></a> <span class="pagenum">[484]</span></p>

</div>


<h4>
<span>"<i>Her mother was her painting.</i>"</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;<cite>Cymbeline</cite>, Act III. Sc. 4.&mdash;I have
read Mr. Halliwell's pamphlet upon this expression, noticed in "N. &amp; Q."
of the 10th of April (p. 358.) I would beg to suggest to that gentleman
that he has overlooked one text in Shakspeare that would tell more for
his argument than the whole of those he has cited. All his examples are
drawn from the word <em>father</em>, metaphorically applied in the sense of
<em>creator</em> to inanimate objects; and the same sense he extends, by
analogy, to <em>mother</em>. But in the following lines from <cite>As You Like It</cite>
(Act III. Sc. 5.), <em>mother</em> is directly used as a sort of warranty of
female beauty! Rosalind is reproving Phebe for her contempt of her
lover, and in derision of her beauty, she asks:</p>

<div class="poem">

              <p class="i3">"Who might be your mother?</p>
      <p>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</p>
      <p>Over the wretched?"</p>

</div>


<p>Now if Phebe had been one who <em>smothered her in painting</em>, an
appropriate answer to Rosalind's question might have been&mdash;her mother
was <em>her painting</em>!</p>

<p>Most certainly, this latter phrase is the more graceful mode of
expressing the idea&mdash;far more in unison with the language one would
expect from the refined, the delicate, the bewitching Imogen&mdash;from her
who wished to set "<em>that parting kiss betwixt two charming words</em>."</p>

<h3>
<span>MANUSCRIPT SHAKSPEARE EMENDATIONS.</span>
</h3>

<p>Your able correspondent M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S. W. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>, in Vol. v., p. 436., gives his
positive adhesion to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER'S</span> emendation of the corruption "bosom
multiplied" in <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, Act III. Sc. 1. Agreeing
 with M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> in
his opinion of the value of this emendation, there is yet an importance
attached to it which I feel sure M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER</span> will not object to have
pointed out, although doubtlessly all the argument respecting the
<em>sources</em> of his early MS. corrections will be carefully considered in
the volume he so liberally intends presenting to the Shakspeare Society.
Shakspearian criticism is a field so open to varied opinions, and is a
subject on which so few can be brought exactly to agree, it is a mere
chance if, in addressing these few lines, I in any degree anticipate
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER'S</span> conclusions.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER'S</span> discovery was, perhaps, of even greater interest to myself
than to others, not merely on account of its being an important evidence
for the state of the text, <em>but because I had long since had the
opportunity of using a volume of precisely similar character</em>,<a id="Page_485"></a> <span class="pagenum">[485]</span>
namely, the copy of the third folio, with numerous MS. emendations in a
coeval hand, mentioned by Lowndes, p. 1646., as having some years since
sold for 65<i>l.</i>, on account of those MS. emendations. This volume
contains several hundred very curious and important corrections, amongst
which I may mention an entirely new reading of the difficult passage at
the commencement of <cite>Measure for Measure</cite>, which carries conviction with
it, and shows, what might have been reasonably expected, that <em>that to</em>
is a misprint <em>for a verb</em>. There are numerous other corrections of
equal importance, but I forbear at present to notice them, under the
conviction it is not safe to adopt MS. corrections, unless we know on
what authority they are made. It was on this account I ventured to
indicate the extreme danger of adopting any of the MS. readings of
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER'S</span> second folio, without a most rigid examination, or until their
authority was unquestionably ascertained. Now, in M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER'S</span> first
two communications to the <cite>Athenæum</cite> there was scarcely a single example
which indicated it was derived from an authentic source, but many, on
the other hand, which could be well believed to be mere guess-work; and
it was rather alarming to see the readiness with which they were
received, threatening the loss of Shakspeare's genuine text.</p>

<p>A ray of light, however, at length appears in the new reading in
<cite>Coriolanus</cite>. This, more than any other, gives hopes of important
results; and it does something more than this: it opens a reasonable
expectation that the MS. corrector had, in some cases, recollection of
the passages as they were delivered in representation. Once establish a
probability of this, and although many of the corrections must still be
looked upon as conjectural, the volume will be of high value. The
correction "<em>bisson multitude</em>" seems to me to be clearly one of those
alterations that no conjectural ingenuity could have suggested. The
volume has evidently been used for stage purposes; and it may be taken
as almost beyond a doubt that that particular correction was made on
authority. We can scarcely imagine that authority to be a MS. of the
play, and are therefore thrown on the supposition the corrector
sometimes altered from memory, and sometimes from conjecture, writing as
he thought Shakspeare <em>ought</em> to have written, even if he did not.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say these observations are grounded solely
on what is already before the public. The appearance of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER'S</span>
volume may modify their effect either one way or the other; and perhaps
I am committing a literary trespass on my friend's manor in thus
prematurely entering into an argument on the subject. But M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER</span>,
with his usual liberality, has invited rather than deprecated
discussion; and having expressed in print opinions grounded on his first
two communications, it would be uncandid in me not to acknowledge they
are in some degree modified by the very important correction since
published.</p>

<span>THE GRAVE-STONE OF JOE MILLER.</span>

<p>In consequence of the disfranchisement of St. Clement's burial-ground,
Portugal Street, Clare Market, the last memorial of "honest Jo" is
condemned for removal; and this being the case, I have forwarded for "N.

and the stone itself, were, about the beginning of the present century,
in jeopardy of obliteration, but for the compassion of Mr. Bulgen, the
grave-digger; and being still in a very bad condition, Mr. Buck a few
years afterwards repaired it. The following is the inscription:</p>

<span>Swearing on a Skull.</span>

<p>&mdash;In April, 1851, a man was committed to Mayo
prison for cutting off the head of a corpse but a few days interred. His
object in severing the head was that of clearing himself of some imputed
crime by swearing on a skull, a superstition said to be very common in
that part of Ireland.</p>

<h4>
<span>Inscription at Dundrah Castle.</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;In the course of a summer spent in
Argyleshire, I paid a visit to old Dundrah, or Dundarrow Castle, which
stands between Inverary and Cairndhu, on the southwest. It is now a
small farm-house. The tenant refused me admission under half-a-crown, so
I contented myself with a survey of the exterior. Over the doorway I
found the following inscription carved in the stone:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "I ' MAN ' BEHALD ' THE ' END ' DE ' NOCHT '</p>
    <p>  VISER ' NOR ' HEIEST ' HOIP ' IN ' GOD."</p>

</div>

<p>The meaning is evident, though what connexion it has with the old castle
I am not able to say. I send it you, as I have not seen it noted in any
book.</p>

<h3>
<span>POEM BY NICHOLAS BRETON.</span>
</h3>

<p>I have recently purchased a small manuscript in quarto, containing
fifteen leaves, written about the year 1590, which consists of a poem in
six cantos, without title or name of the author, but which, I feel
convinced, from the style, is one of the numerous works of Nicholas
Breton. In the hope that some of your correspondents may be able to
identify the poem, which may possibly be printed in some of Breton's
very rare works, I subjoin the commencing stanzas:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="noindent">"Where should I finde that melancholy muse,</p>
        <p>That never hard of any thinge but mone,</p>
    <p class="noindent">And reade the passiones that her pen doth use,</p>
       <p> When she and sorrow sadlye sitt alone</p>
     <p class="noindent">To tell the world more then the world can tell</p>
     <p class="noindent">What fits indeed most fitlye figure hell.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

   <p class="noindent">"Lett me not thinke once of the smalest thought</p>
        <p>May speake of less then of the greatest gref,</p>
   <p class="noindent">Wher every sence with sorrowes overwrought</p>
        <p>Lives but in death, dispayring of relef,</p>
     <p class="noindent">While thus the harte with torments torne asunder</p>
      <p class="noindent">Maye of the worlde be cal'd the wofull wonder."</p>

   </div>

</div>

<p>These two stanzas are by no means favourable specimens of the entire
poem, but I prefer to give them, because the work itself may be printed.
If it appears, on inquiry, to be still inedited, I may venture to submit
a few other extracts from it of a more illustrative character. Our
bibliographers would be more useful guides, were they always to give the
first lines of old poems. I have a tolerably good library, but can find
no work sufficiently descriptive of Breton's works to enable me to trace
the above.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE VIRTUOSI, OR ST. LUKE'S CLUB.</span>
</h3>


<p>Where is to be found that intensely interesting MS. Lot 120., Sixth
Day's Sale, at Strawberry Hill, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">folio tract</i> entitled <cite>The
"Virtuosi," or St. Luke's Club, held at the Rose Tavern, first
established by Sir Anthony Vandyke; with Autographs of all the eminent
Artists of the day</cite>?</p>

<p>Such is the account of Mr. George Robins, to the sound of whose hammer
it fell, let us hope, into worthy hands.</p>

<p>By the aid of a note made whilst the several precious contents of that
"Gothic Vatican of Greece and Rome," as I think Pope described it, were
on view, I hope to whet the appetite of some of our literary vultures:</p>


   <p class="blockquot"> "Rose Tavern, Mar. 5. 1697. </p>

   <p class="blockquot">   "An order for raising an annual fund for pictures; with twenty
   names of stewards."</p>


<p>What say you, Mr. Editor, to such subscribing parties as, among others,
"Grinling Gibbons, Michael Dahl, J. Closterman, and Christopher Wren?" I
cannot remember more, but I think "Alex. Verrio" was among them.</p>

<p>Mem. the second: as entries in a sort of journal:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"That our steward, John Chicheley, Esquire, gave us this day a
   Westphalia Ham, which had been omitted in his entertainment on
   St. Luke's day."</p>

<p>Again:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">    "Paid and spent at Spring Gardens, by Knightsbridge,
      forfeiture        <span class="right1">£3 15 <i>shgs.</i>"</span></p>

<p>Why, Mr. Editor, here are the new Roxburgh Revels of the Knights of the
Brush and Palette. And now that the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the
day is expected to take out his diploma, and the ex-Premier is to be the
new Professor of Perspective, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice</i> the author of the <cite>Fallacies of
Hope</cite>, it becomes a question of prevailing interest, which I commend to
the research of your dilettanti querists. It may be a thread of
connexion with those stores of precious materials obtained by Walpole
from the widow of that persevering investigator George Virtue.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE RABBIT AS A SYMBOL.</span>
</h3>


<p>The 29th vol. of the <cite>Archæologia</cite> contains an interesting "description
of a monumental effigy of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, recently discovered
in the cathedral of Notre Dame at Rouen," by Alfred Way, Esq., who, with
his usual precision, has noticed what he very properly calls "some
singular details" beneath the figure of the lion crouching at the king's
feet; among these details is "the head of <em>a rabbit</em><a id="bit1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> peeping out of
its burrow, and, a little above, a dog warily watching the mouth of the
hole." Mr. Way adds:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "I have met with nothing among the accessory ornaments of
   monumental sculpture analogous to this; and though convinced that
   what in itself may appear a trifling detail, <em>was not placed here
   without design</em>, I am quite at a loss to conjecture what could
   have been its import."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#bit1" class="label">[1]</a> Mr. Way says <em>a hare</em> or rabbit, forgetting that the
   hare does not burrow.</p>

<p>The same symbol or device, well known to all lovers of ancient
wood-engraving, appears in some of the earliest specimens of that art.
It is found in an impression of one of the oldest known playing-cards,
representing the knave of diamonds, now in the print-room of the British
Museum, of which a fac-simile is inserted at p. 214. of Chatto's
<cite>History of Playing Cards</cite>. Another instance of this device occurs
(without the dog) in an old woodcut, dated 1418, discovered a few years
ago at Malines, of which a copy appeared in the <cite>Athenæum</cite> of Oct. 4,
1845. And a third example is contained in that celebrated and unique
woodcut of St. Christopher, dated 1423, in the possession<a id="Page_488"></a> <span class="pagenum">[488]</span> of Earl
Spencer, copies of which may be found in Janson's <cite>Essai sur l'Origine
de la Gravure</cite>, and in Ottley's work. Being as fully convinced as Mr.
Way that the symbols he observed on the effigy of Richard at Rouen were
<em>never introduced without design</em>, but that they were meant to convey
some esoteric signification, I have for many years consulted both books
and friends to obtain an explanation of this allegorical device, but
without success. As a last resource, I address myself to the "N. &amp; Q.,"
in hopes, from their having now obtained so wide a circulation, that I
may receive through their medium, and the kindness of a more learned
correspondent, a solution of this enigma.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;In addition to the above <em>four</em> instances of the device of <em>a
rabbit</em> occurring in ancient sculpture and wood-engraving, a French
writer, M. Th. Gautier, in the feuilleton of <cite>La Presse</cite> of the 27th
September, 1851, describes the Madonna of Albert Durer as being "presque
toujours accompagnée <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d'un lapin</i>," derived (in his opinion) from a
"vague ressouvenir du panthéisme Germanique."</p>

<h3>
<span>IS WYLD'S GREAT GLOBE A PLAGIARISM FROM MOLENAX?<br />
(Vol. v., p. 467.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Some time ago I made the following Notes, which, though they throw some
light on the subject of Molineux's globe, yet they do not bear out
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> E<span class="smcap lowercase">ASTWOOD'S</span> conjecture. The first is from Richard Hakluyt's Address to
the Reader in <cite>The Principal Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of
the English Nation</cite>, folio, 1589:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Nowe, because peraduenture it would bee expected as necessarie,
   that the descriptions of so many parts of the world would farre
   more easily be conceiued of the Reader, by adding Geographicall
   and Hydrographicall tables thereunto, thou art by the way to be
   admonished that I haue contented myselfe with inserting into the
   worke one of the best generall mappes of the world onely, vntill
   the comming out of a very large and most exact terrestriall
   Globe, collected and reformed according to the newest, secretest,
   and latest discoueries, both Spanish, Portugall, and English,
   composed by M. <em>Emmerie Mollineux</em> of Lambeth, a rare Gentleman
   in his profession, being therein for divers yeeres greatly
   supported by the purse and liberalitie of the worshipfull
   marchant M. <em>William Sanderson</em>."</p>

<p>My second Note is from the rare little volume by John Davis, entitled,
<cite>The Worlde's Hydrographical Discription</cite>, 12mo., London, 1595:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "The cause why I vse this particular relation of all my
   proceedinges for this discouery, is to stay this obiection, why
   hath not <em>Dauis</em> discouered this passage [the North-west] being
   thrise that waies imploied, and how far I proceeded, and in what
   fourme this discouery lyeth, doth appeare vpon the Globe which
   Master <em>Sanderson</em> to his verye great charge hath published,
   whose labouring indevour for the good of his countrie deserueth
   great fauour and commendations, made by Master <em>Emery Mullineux</em>,
   a man wel qualited, of a good iudgement and verye expert in many
   excellent practises, in myselfe being the onely meane with Master
   <em>Sanderson</em> to imploy Master Mullineux therein, whereby he is
   nowe growne to a most exquisite perfection."</p>

    <p class="author1">P. 25.</p>

<p>And here a Query may not be out of place. Whose account of Iceland does
Nash refer to?</p>

<p>In the writings of our early navigators, there is frequent allusion to
terrestrial globes. This of Mollineux's, for instance, contains Davis's
own discoveries, and should therefore be of some importance. In the
tract just quoted, Davis says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "It is wel knowne that we haue globes in the most excellent
   perfection of arte, and haue the vse of them in as exquisite
   sort, as Master <em>Robert Hues</em> in his book of the globes vse,
   lately published, hath at large made known."</p>

   <p class="author1">P. 41.</p>

<p class="noindent">And in an unpublished MS. relating to Sir Thomas Button's voyage,
addressed to King James I. in 1610, the writer says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "I haue left w<span class="topnum">th</span> Mr. Wright in yo<span class="topnum">r</span> librarie att S<span class="topnum">t </span>James, <cite>a
   hand globe terrestriall</cite> for demonstrac&#773;on of these."</p>

<p>Do any of the globes exist, and where?</p>

<p>As I am about to reprint Davis's tract with additional illustrations,
including the MS. above referred to, I shall be glad to receive any
particulars of the life of Davis, and of his connexion with that great
patron of discovery, William Sanderson; of his death, any reference to
his autograph, and to any authentic portrait of him.</p>

<h4>
<span>Poem on the Burning of the Houses of Parliament.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;On the 17th of
October, 1834, the houses of parliament were burnt down, and I believe
you will recollect that very soon afterwards a long serio-comic poem was
published, detailing the event; the following stray morsels of which
just occur to me:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p> "And poor Mrs. Wright,</p>

<p class="noindent">True, oft have I heard of thee, Count Gondomar, and have read from time
to time divers anecdotes of thy wit and wisdom, quips and quiddities.
But is it not passing strange that this man, this Spanish Don, who, as
is well known, exercised such a powerful influence over the weak-minded
"Solomon of Whitehall," and who, moreover, bore so large a share in the
murder of the brave and highly gifted Raleigh, should be excluded from a
niche in the biographical temple; for such I am told is the case. Having
deputed a friend to make search for me in the several biographical
dictionaries, he reports that the name of Gondomar is <em>not</em> to be found
in the best book of the kind, the <cite>Biographie Universelle</cite>, nor in the
dictionaries of Rose and Chalmers. This desideratum will, I confidently
hope, ere long be supplied through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," by some of

structure, stands some two hundred yards back in the grounds through
which, from the road to the front door of the house, extends a fine
avenue of chestnuts, terminated at the roadside by a pair of venerable,
rusty, and decaying iron gates <em>which are kept closed</em>; the entrance to
the park being by a sort of side gateway of insignificant and field-like
appearance further on. Can any of your readers give me the facts, or the
local tradition which accounts for this peculiarity? I believe it is a
family incident of somewhat historical interest, and a subject on which

<p>My Query is, from whence and at what date these two offices sprang into

<span>Antiquity of Vanes.</span>

<p>&mdash;We are informed by Baron Maseres, as quoted by

in the shape of birds or dragons fixed on their masts, to point out the
direction of the wind. Is there any<a id="Page_491"></a> <span class="pagenum">[491]</span> record of an earlier adoption

<h4>
<span>Richard of Cirencester de Situ Britanniæ.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Is this work a forgery or
not? Charles Julius Bertram, Professor of English in the Royal Marine
Academy at Copenhagen, wrote to Dr. Stukeley in 1747 that such a
manuscript was in the hands of a friend of his. It was not until some
time had elapsed, and after Dr. Stukeley was presented to St. George's
Church, Queen Square, that he "pressed Mr. Bertram to get the manuscript
into his own hands, if possible; which, at length, with some difficulty,
he accomplished;" and sent to Dr. Stukeley, in letters, a transcript of
the whole. Authors go on quoting from this work as genuine authority,
and therefore are perhaps misleading themselves and their readers; and
it would be conferring a great boon if "N. &amp; Q." could clear up the
doubt as to its authenticity.</p>

<p>Mr. Worsaae, the eminent Danish author, or his English translator, are
exactly in the position to render this further service to antiquarian
literature; and, as relating to the subject of Roman Britain, the
question is of so much interest that a little trouble would not,
probably, be deemed uselessly expended in the inquiry.</p>

on shore a good deal of their treasure which he wanted to secure for
himself. Where is any account of it to be found? How came Spanish ships

<h4>
<span>Analysis of Newton's Principia.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the <cite>Journal des Savants</cite> for
April of this year, the celebrated mathematician Biot, in a review of
the <cite>Correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton and Cotes</cite> (Cambridge, 1850),
makes mention, with the highest praise, of an analysis of Sir Isaac's
<cite>Principia</cite> contained in the <cite>Acta Eruditorum</cite> for 1688. Mons. Biot says
that at that time there were only two men who could have written such an
analysis, Halley and Newton himself; but adds, that the style is not
Halley's, being too concise and simple for him. His admiration could not
have been contained within such bounds. M. Biot firmly believes that the
writer of this analysis was no other than Newton himself (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex ungue
Leonem</i>), and earnestly calls on the learned of England and Germany to
assist in discovering the origin of the analysis; should there perhaps
be any means left for doing so in the literary depôts of the two
countries. Permit a contributor to "N. &amp; Q." to repeat M. Biot's inquiry
through the medium of a publication far more extensively circulated in
England than the <cite>Journal des Savants</cite>.</p>

   hats manufactured from their own wool: one or two travelling
   hatters occasionally settled at Bangor, who made and sold
   <em>beaver</em> hats. We do not think that the women here intended to
   adopt any particular costume; but retained the hat as agreeing
   with the peculiar close cap, and <em>projecting</em> border, which it
   leaves in view, and in <em>possession of its own uprightness</em>! The

 <p class="left"> Temple, Shrove Tuesday, 1852.</p>


 <p class="blockquot">  [Fosbrooke, in his <cite>Encyclopædia of Antiquities</cite>, vol. ii. p.
   572., informs us that "Pancakes, the Norman <em>Crispellæ</em>, are
   taken from the Fornacalia, on Feb. 18, in memory of the practice
   in use before the goddess Fornax invented ovens." The Saxons
   called February "Solmonath," which Dr. Frank Sayers, in his
   <cite>Disquisitions</cite>, says is explained by Bede "Mensis placentarum,"
   and rendered by Spelman, in an inedited manuscript, "Pancake
   Month," because in the course of it cakes were offered by the
   Pagan Saxons to the sun. So much for the "when:" now for the
   reason "why" the custom was adopted by the Christian church.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> Shrove Tuesday, or Pancake Tuesday, as it is sometimes called,
   from being the vigil of Ash Wednesday, was a day when every one
   was bound to confess, and be shrove or shriven. That none might
   plead forgetfulness of this duty, the great bell was rung at an
   early hour in every parish, called the Pancake Bell, for the
   following reasons given by Taylor, the Water Poet, in his
   <cite>Jacke-a-Lent</cite> (<cite>Works</cite>, p. 115. fol. 1630). He tells us, "On
   Shrove Tuesday there is a bell rung, called the Pancake Bell, the
   sound whereof makes thousands of people distracted, and forgetful
   either of manner or humanitie. Then there is a thinge called
   wheaten floure, which the sulphory, necromanticke cookes doe
   mingle with water, egges, spice, and<a id="Page_492"></a> <span class="pagenum">[492]</span> other tragicall,
   magicall inchantments, and then they put it by little and little
   into a frying-pan of boyling suet, where it makes a confused
   dismal hissing, like the Lernean snakes in the reeds of Acheron,
   Stix, or Phlegeton, until at last by the skill of the cooke it is
   transformed into the forme of a <em>Flap-Jack</em>, which in our
   translation is called a <em>Pancake</em>, which ominous incantation the
   ignorant people doe devoure very greedily, having for the most
   part well dined before; but they have no sooner swallowed that
   sweet-candied baite, but straight their wits forsake them, and
   they runne starke mad, assembling in routs and throngs
   numberlesse of ungovernable numbers, with uncivill civill
   commotions." In the "Forme of Cury," published with other cookery
   in Warner's <cite>Antiquitates Culinariæ</cite>, p. 33., and written in
   1390, we find a kind of fried cakes called "comadore," composed
   of figs, raisins, and other fruits, steeped in wine, and folded
   up in paste, to be fried in oil. This suggests another savoury
   Query, Whether this is not an improvement on our apple fritters?]</p>

<h3>
<span>THE RING FINGER.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 114. 371.)</span>
</h3>


<p>My subsequent reading has not only confirmed, but added to the
information conveyed in the reference quoted. I there surmised that the
third was the ring finger, because the thumb and first two fingers have
always been reserved as symbols of the blessed Trinity, and consequently
the third was the first vacant finger. Both the Greek and Latin church
agree in this, that the thumb and first two fingers signify the blessed
Trinity. And whilst these three fingers signify the Trinity, the third
and fourth fingers are emblematic of the two natures of Christ, the
human and divine. As then the third finger served to symbolise the human
nature, and marriage was instituted to propagate the human race, that
was made the wedding finger. The right hand is the hand of power: hence
the wife wears the ring on the ring finger of the <em>left hand</em>. The
Greeks make each of the first three fingers, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> the thumb and two
fingers, symbolise one of the divine persons. M. Didron informs us that,
during his visit to Greece in 1839, the Archbishop of Mistra&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Whom I interrogated on the subject, informed me that the thumb,
   from its strength, indicated the Creator, the Father Eternal, the
   Almighty; that the middle finger was dedicated to Jesus Christ,
   who redeemed us; and that the forefinger, between the thumb and
   middle finger, figured the Holy Ghost, who proceeds from the
   Father and the Son, and in representations of the blessed Trinity
   is placed between those two persons."</p>

<p>A bishop's ring is emblematic of the gifts of the Holy Ghost: and
formerly bishops wore their ring on the forefinger of the right hand.</p>

<p>Pray let the lady be comforted! Surely the most punctilious Rubrician
will make no impertinent inquiries about the missing finger, so long as

<h3>
<span>THE MORAVIAN HYMNS.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 30. 474.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Having followed with interest the late discussion in your pages upon the
earlier specimens of those strange productions, the Moravian Hymns, it
seems to me, that although much that is curious has been elicited, the
Query of P. H., touching the genuineness of the extraordinary sample
reproduced by him from the <cite>Oxford Magazine</cite> for 1769, remains
unanswered. It is therefore with a view to supply some information
directly to this point, that I now beg to introduce to your readers <em>my</em>
earliest edition, which looks very like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">editio princeps</i> of Part
III.: at all events it takes precedence of that described by H. C. B.
Its title is, <cite>A Collection of Hymns, consisting chiefly of Translations
from the German Hymn-book of the Moravian Brethren</cite>. Part III. Small
8vo. pp. 168. London, printed for James Hutton, 1748.</p>

<p>At first sight there would appear to be no difference between H. C. B.'s
volume and mine, beyond the latter being the earlier by one year;<a id="Page_493"></a> <span class="pagenum">[493]</span>
that year, however, seems to have been the exact period when the
Brethren deemed it advisable, to avoid scandal, to revise and prune
their hymn-book.</p>

<p>"In this part (especially) of our hymn-book," says the Preface, "a good
deal of liberty has been taken in dispensing with what otherwise is
customary and ornamental: and that for different reasons." Then follow
these three reasons: the hymns being printed in prose, to save room; the
retention of German diminutives which, although scarcely known in the
English tongue, "have a certain elegance and effect" in the former
language; and the use of "more antique, prosaic, and less polished
diction, out of tenderness for the main point, the expressing more
faithfully the doctrines of the congregation, rather than seek better at
the expense of the sense."</p>

<p>"So much," continues the Preface, "seemed proper to mention to exempt
this Book (which though calculated for our own congregation, will no
doubt come into the hands of strangers) from the imputation of a
needless singularity. Now we only wish that every Reader may also feel
something of that solid and happy Bottom, from whence these free,
familiar, and perhaps abrupt Aspirations, both in the composing and
using of them, do sparkle forth: And so we commit this <cite>Third Part</cite> of
our Hymn-book to the Providence and Blessing of that dear Redeemer, who
with his Ever-blessed Atonement, is everywhere the subject thereof."</p>

<p>As to the hymns themselves, I need say little more to describe them than
to observe that the present edition contains not only the one quoted by
P. H. from the <cite>Oxford Magazine</cite>, but all the others which are there to
be found, and which have raised doubt in your correspondent's mind
whether they are not rather the fabrications of Anti-Moravians than
genuine productions, and at the periods in use among the Brethren. Here,
too, is to be found the "Chicken Blessed" of Anstey: in his <cite>Bath Guide</cite>
he correctly quotes it as "No. 33. in Count Zinzendorf's
Hymn-book,"&mdash;that being its position in the present volume. The satirist
has, however, given only half of "the learned Moravian's ode," but that
faithfully. Besides these there are some of the hymns enumerated by
Rimius in his <cite>Candid Narrative of the Herrnhuters</cite> (London, 1753), in
support of his charges against them.</p>

<p>Probably your readers are content with the specimens which have already
appeared in your columns. Had it been otherwise, this curious volume
would have supplied some of a singular character: as it is, I cannot
resist extracting No. 77. and a part of No. 110.; the former relating an
adventure between the Arch-Enemy and Saint Martin; the latter,
"Concerning the happy little Birds in the Cross's-air, or in the
Atmosphere of the Corpse of Jesus:"</p>

hymns, that the later impression is always the <em>tamer</em>.</p>

<h3>
<span>CAGOTS.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 190.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I arrive at the conclusion, that the Cacosi of Latin writers, Cacous, or
Cagous, represent the<a id="Page_494"></a> <span class="pagenum">[494]</span> true name from which Cagots, the <em>t</em> being
mute, is but a slight deviation; while some other forms have scarcely
retained more than the initial <em>Ca</em>. The etymology from the Goths (most
absurd <em>in substance</em>, and worthy of the days when Languedoc was fetched
from <em>Land-got</em>, Land of the Goths,) has reference only to one of the
French spellings.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cacosus</i>, meaning a leper, as well as a Cacous or Cagot, was from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="[Greek: kakon]">&#954;&#945;&#954;&#8056;&#957;</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="[Greek: kakôsis]">&#954;&#8049;&#954;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, in Greek; and from it came
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cacosomium</i>, contracted for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cacoso-comium</i>, not a mere <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noso-comium</i>,
but an asylum for lepers. See Ducange.</p>

<p>But the Cacous in question were not only lepers, but families in which
leprosy was considered hereditary. For this reason they are called
Giezites, les Gézits, les Gesitains, from Giezi, servant of Elisha and
his posterity. (See Michel, vol. i. pp. 56. 148. 238. &amp;c.) A simple
leper was Lazarius or ladre. The latter were, like Lazarus, merely
afflicted; but the former were deemed to be under an abiding curse, like
Giezi.</p>

<p>But those who were Giezites by condition, as inheriting and transmitting
the disease, were by many of the vulgar imagined to be Giezites by
blood, and the real posterity of Elisha's servant, "Cagots de Chanaan."
By an equally natural result, persons actually free from disease were
shunned as Cacous; since the stigma attached to the race, not to the
individual. Indeed, the wearing out of the malady has created the whole
obscurity of the case.</p>

<p>Their most curious title, Crestiaas or Christians, was not given them in
direct affirmation, but in denial of a negative, "not non-christian."
Because, being considered of Giezi's lineage, not only Jews, but Jews
under a curse, many would be disposed to repell them from communion. See
Dom Lepelletier's <cite>Dict. Bretonne</cite>, in C<span class="smcap lowercase">ACOUS</span>.</p>

<p>Whether hereditary lepra was rightly thought to exist, or whether the
negligence of the more abject and squalid families in communicating it
to each other falsely raised that idea, is a separate question, which I
must leave to physicians.</p>

<h3>
<span>SHERIFFS AND LORDS LIEUTENANT.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 394.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Dalton saith:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Vice comites have the same authority that the antient comites
   had; and at this day there are some relicts of that dignity, for
   he hath <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">album baculum</i>, and the grant of the office is
   commisimus vobis [comitatum]. And also he takes place of every
   nobleman during the time that he is in office."</p>

<p>The Writ of Assistance ran thus:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "To archbishops, bishops, dukes, earls, barons, knights,
   freeholders, and all others of our county of C. Whereas we have
   committed to our well-beloved A. B. the custody of our said
   county, with the appurtenances, during our pleasure, We command
   you that ye be aiding, answering, and assisting to the said A. B.
   as our sheriff of our said county in all things which appertain
   to the said office."</p>

<p>This form was abolished in 1833. The Lord Lieutenant is a military
officer, who appears to have grown into permanence under the Tudors. The
office of Custos Rotulorum, which, though quite distinct, is usually
joined with it, is much more ancient; its duties are to keep the records
of the sessions, which involve the appointment of the clerk of the
peace, and the power of recommending to the Great Seal of persons to be
inserted in the commission of the peace.</p>

<p>As for instances of such precedence being <em>claimed</em>, it is not easy to
recollect what is usually taken as a thing so much of course. Perhaps
the instance of a Duke, who had been Lord Lieutenant forty years,
apologising to a Sheriff for having inadvertently taken precedence, may
serve.</p>

    <p class="right">  V<span class="smcap lowercase">ICE</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OM</span>. D<span class="smcap lowercase">EPUTAT</span>.</p>


<p>In answer to L. J.'s inquiry, upon what authority the precedency of the
Sheriff over the Lord Lieutenant is maintained; may it not partly be
founded on the office of Sheriff being of greater antiquity, and on this
officer having the command over, and the power of summoning all the
people of the county above the age of fifteen, and under the degree of a
peer? The office of Lord Lieutenant was first created in the third year
of King Edward VI., to suppress, as Strype tells us, "the routs and
uproars" in most of the counties. We might suppose that the Sheriff
already possessed sufficient power for this purpose: the means then
adopted to promote tranquillity were not well calculated to be popular
among the people. No drum or pipe was to be struck or sounded. Plays
were forbidden. In the churches of Devonshire and Cornwall, Lord Russell
was to take down every bell in a steeple but one, so as to prevent a
peal being rung.</p>

<p>The precedency in question is acted upon to the present hour; and a Lord
Lieutenant, however high his rank in the peerage, gives place to the
Sheriff as a matter of course. But do not both these officers yield
precedence to her Majesty's justices of assize, when actually engaged on
the circuit?</p>

<h3>
<span>ST. CHRISTOPHER.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 295. 334. 372.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Two questions are asked by E. A. H. L. concerning St. Christopher: 1.
<em>Are there any known representations of St. Christopher in painted
glass?</em> There is a very interesting example in a window in <em>St. Neot's
Church, Cornwall</em>. It represents St. Christopher with the child Jesus on
his back, and<a id="Page_495"></a> <span class="pagenum">[495]</span> below has the legend: "Sante Christophere, ora pro
me." This ancient window was presented to the church by three members of
the Borlase family. Their benefaction is recorded in the inscription
along the cill of the window:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Orate pro animabus Catherine Burlas, Nicolai Burlas, et Johannis
   Vyvian, qui istam fenestram fieri fecerunt."</p>

<p>Another example of St. Christopher, bearing the divine infant, is in one
of the lights of the three-light window over the altar of <em>All Saints'
Church, North Street, York</em>. It is the work of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>In the same city, <em>St. John's Church, Micklegate</em>, has two
representations of St. Christopher in glass. One is the window north of
the altar, but it is only a portion of the figure; the other is in the
window south of the altar, and of perpendicular character. In <em>St.
Martin-le-Grand, Coney Street</em>, in the sixth or eastern window of the
north aisle, is a figure of St. Christopher, of date about 1450. <em>St.
Michael-le-Belfroy</em>, in the same city, has two figures of the saint:
one, of perpendicular character, in the window north of the altar; the
other, a fragment, in the fourth window from the east end on the south
side, of date between 1540 and 1550. <em>Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate</em>,
possesses a very beautiful figure of the saint. It forms the fifth of a
series of five large figures in the east window of the church, and seems
to bear the date 1470.</p>

<p>The second question is, "What is the real meaning of the representations
of St. Christopher that are so frequently found on the north walls of
churches?" I cannot agree with MR. J. E<span class="smcap lowercase">ASTWOOD</span> in thinking that the
explanation he gives from <cite>Sacred and Legendary Art is sufficiently
satisfactory</cite>. It appears to me that the figures of St. Christopher were
meant to symbolise the privilege enjoyed by the faithful of receiving
the body and blood of Christ, and thus becoming <em>Christo-feri</em>. The
emblem may have had its origin in the earliest ages, when the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disciplina arcani</i> was carried out. This opinion receives strength from
the circumstance, that Christopher was a name assumed by the saint, and
not his baptismal name. The extraordinary powers of cure spoken of in
verses often inscribed below the figures of this saint, were understood
by the faithful to allude to the efficacy of the Holy Communion, that
made them <em>Christopher's</em>, i.e. persons bearing their blessed Saviour,
not on their shoulders, but within their breasts. His figures in
sculpture and painting are always represented as colossal, to signify
that this heavenly food makes each of the faithful "as a giant to run
the way" (Ps. xix. 5.) This explanation will probably satisfy E. A. H.
L. that the important position occupied by St. Christopher in the
iconography of the mediæval church is to be solved by its symbolical
signification.</p>

<p>In addition to the representations of this saint in painted glass
mentioned above, E. A. H. L. will find mention of another specimen in
the last number of the <cite>Archæological Journal</cite>. It is in private hands,
being the property of Mr. Lucas, who purchased a collection of specimens
of old glass some years since at Guildford, said to have come from an
old mansion in Surrey. The specimen in question is described as "St.
Christopher carrying our Saviour&mdash;an octagonal piece of glass."&mdash;P. 101.</p>

<p>He will also find, in the same place, that a mural painting of St.
Christopher has been lately discovered in the chancel of Gawsworth
Church, Cheshire, of which a description is given in p. 103.</p>

   <p class="right">C<span class="smcap lowercase">EYREP</span>.</p>

<p>E. A. H. L. asks if there is any known representation of St. Christopher
in painted glass. There is one in All Saints, York, engraved in Weale's
<cite>Papers</cite>; and there is a small one on a brass in Tattershall Church.</p>

   <p class="right">   C. T.</p>

<p>For information on this subject, I would refer E. A. H. L. to Warton,
<cite>Poetry</cite>, vol. i. p. 451.; Coryatt's <cite>Crudities</cite>, vol. i. p. 29.;
Rudder's <cite>Gloucestershire</cite>, p. 286.; Gage's <cite>Hengrave</cite>, p. 64.;
<cite>Winckelm. Stosch</cite>, ch. i. n. 103.</p>

<p>On a loose print of "Painted Glass at Leicester," Throsby del. 1788, now
before me, is a representation of him who was once Psychicus the savage,
but now the holy Saint Christopher, figured, as usual, under the
likeness of a man of gigantic stature, carrying on his shoulder the
little child Jesus, through the broad and deep waters of a turbulent
river, and steadying his steps with an uprooted palm-tree laden with
fruit, which he bears in his hands by way of staff. He is here exhibited
in more seemly habiliments, and as a personage of much more dignified
and venerable appearance, than in the well-known picture on the walls of
Wotton Church. The latter, however, is a portraiture of superior
antiquarian interest, on account of its accessories, wherein St.
Christopher's especial office, as patron of field sports, is, with much
rudeness it is true, but most efficiently and fully illustrated.</p>

<p>In the extract given by J. E<span class="smcap lowercase">ASTWOOD</span> from <cite>Sacred and Legendary Art</cite>, we
have merely the supposititious conclusions of an ingenious imagination,
introduced to supply a void which the accomplished writer was unable
otherwise to fill up. There is a pretty little work published by Burns,
and entitled <cite>St. Christopher; a Painting in Fordholme Church</cite>, which
contains, much too much, however, in the suspicious form of a modern
religious allegory, what professes to be the authentic "Legend" of this
saint.</p>

   <p class="right">  C<span class="smcap lowercase">OWGILL</span>.</p>


<p>E. A. H. L. makes the inquiry whether "there are any known
representations of St. Christopher<a id="Page_496"></a> <span class="pagenum">[496]</span> in <em>painted glass</em>; if so,
where?" This I am unable to answer; but your learned correspondent
J<span class="smcap lowercase">ARLTZBERG</span> having sent you one version of the legend attached to this
saint, may I venture to remind you of another? This is the one attached
to the celebrated picture, "The Descent from the Cross," by Rubens, in
the cathedral of Antwerp, in which the painter, adopting the Greek
derivation of the name as given by J<span class="smcap lowercase">ARLTZBERG</span>, represents the saint
supporting Christ on his removal from the crucifix. The picture was
painted for the Arquebusiers of Antwerp, whose patron was St.
Christopher; but they were dissatisfied with it, and refused Rubens his
promised reward, a piece of land in their possession contiguous to his
own, for which he had accomplished this, certainly one of his most
beautiful paintings.</p>

<p>This was in the year 1688, just seven days after, according to Macaulay,
that he had fled secretly from the kingdom, having previously thrown the
great seal into the Thames, whence it was dredged up some months after
by a fisherman. Being driven back by stress of weather, he returned to
London, and on the 17th Pepys states,</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "That night was a council; his Ma<span class="topnum">ty</span> refuses to assent to all
   the proposals, goes away again to Rochester."</p>

<p class="noindent">and <em>on that very night</em> was this pardon granted, James probably
endeavouring to prop up his tottering<a id="Page_497"></a> <span class="pagenum">[497]</span> cause by attaching as many
as possible to his own party. There were several documents in the
collection of the late Josiah Trench, Esq., of Windsor (1648-1652)
signed by John Trenchard, among the other regicides. Ewing, in his
<cite>Norfolk Lists</cite>, states that a portrait of him is in existence, and that
he was a serjeant-at-law, and at this date (1688) M. P. for Thetford,
being at that date merely an esquire. In 1692, according to the same
authority, Sir John Trenchard was Secretary of State; and his death took
place in 1694. I should be glad to add to these scanty notices,
especially as regards the reason which rendered a pardon necessary at
this time.</p>

<h4>
<span>Dayesman</span>
<span>(Vol. i., p. 189.).</span>

<p>&mdash;Bishop Jewell writes:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "M. Harding would have had us put God's word to <em>daying</em> (i.e. to
   <em>trial</em>), and none otherwise to be obedient to Christ's
   commandment, than if a few bishops gathered at Trident shall
   allow it."&mdash;<cite>Replie to Harding</cite>, <cite>Works</cite>, vol. ii. p. 424. (Dr.

<p>And <em>Dayesman</em> is he, the man, "who fixes the <em>day</em>, who is present, or
sits as judge, arbiter, or umpire on the <em>day</em> fixed or appointed."</p>

<p>It is evident that Richardson made much use of Jewell; but this word

<p>&mdash;We certainly do not want the aid of
Obadiah Bull and Joe Dun to account for these words. Milton writes, "I
affirm it to be a <em>bull</em>, taking away the essence of that, which it
calls itself." And a <em>bull</em> is, "that which expresses something in
opposition to what is intended, wished, or felt;" and so named "from the
contrast of humble profession with despotic commands of Papal bulls."</p>

<h4>
<span>Algernon Sidney</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 447.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I do not intend to enter the
lists in defence of this "illustrious patriot." The pages of "N. &amp; Q."
are not a fit battle ground. But I request you to insert the whole
quotation, that your readers may judge with what amount of fairness C.
has made his note from Macaulay's <cite>History</cite>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Communications were opened between Barillon, the ambassador of
   Lewis, and those English politicians who had always professed,
   and who indeed sincerely felt, the greatest dread and dislike of
   the French ascendancy. The most upright member of the country
   party, William Lord Russell, son of the Earl of Bedford, did not
   scruple to concert with a foreign mission schemes for
   embarrassing his own sovereign. This was the whole extent of
   Russell's offence. His principles and his fortune alike raised
   him above all temptations of a sordid kind: but there is too much
   reason to believe that some of his associates were less
   scrupulous. It would be unjust to impute to them the extreme
   wickedness of taking bribes to injure their country. On the
   contrary, they meant to serve her: but it is impossible to deny
   that they were mean and indelicate enough to let a foreign prince
   pay them for serving her. Among those who cannot be acquitted of
   this degrading charge was one man who is popularly considered as
   the personification of public spirit, and who, in spite of some
   great moral and intellectual faults, has a just claim to be
   called a hero, a philosopher, and a patriot. It is impossible to
   see without pain such a name in the list of the pensioners of
   France. Yet it is some consolation to reflect that in our own
   time a public man would be thought lost to all sense of duty and
   shame who should not spurn from him a temptation which conquered
   the virtue and the pride of Algernon Sidney."</p>

<h4>
<span>Age of Trees</span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 401. 488.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;At Neustadt, in Wirtemberg,
there is a prodigious lime-tree, which gives its name to the town, which
is called <em>Neustadt an der Linden</em>. The age of this tree is said to be
1000 years. According to a German writer, it required the support of
sixty pillars in the year 1392, and attained its present size in 1541.
It now rests, says the same authority, on above one hundred props, and
spreads out so far that a market can be held under its shade. It is of
this tree that Evelyn says it was&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Set about with divers columns and monuments of stone (eighty-two
   in number, and formerly above one hundred more), which several
   princes and nobles have adorned, and which as so many pillars
   serve likewise to support the umbrageous and venerable boughs;
   and that even the tree had been much ampler the ruins and
   distances of the columns declare, which the rude soldiers have
   greatly impaired."</p>

<p>There is another colossal specimen of the same species in the churchyard
of the village of Cadiz, near Dresden. The circumference of the trunk is
forty feet. Singularly, though it is completely hollow through age, its
inner surface is coated with a fresh and healthy bark.</p>

<p>&mdash;In reference to
your correspondents' observations on skeleton monuments, I may mention
that there is one inserted in the wall of the yard of St. Peter's
Church, Drogheda. It is in high relief, cut in a dark stone and the
skeleton figure half shrouded by grave clothes is a sufficiently
appalling object. Beside it stands another figure still "in the flesh."
It is many years since I saw the monument,<a id="Page_498"></a> <span class="pagenum">[498]</span> and whether there be
any inscription legible upon it, or whether it be generally known to
whom it belongs, I cannot inform you.</p>

<p>There is a very good instance of an "altar tomb," bearing on it an
ordinary effigy, and containing within it a skeleton figure, visible
through pierced panel work, in Fyfield Church, Berks. It is the monument
of Sir John Golafre, temp. Hen. V. Another fine instance I remember to

<h4>
<span>Bee Park</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 322.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In this neighbourhood is an ancient
farm-house called Bee Hall, where I doubt not that bees were kept in
great quantities in bygone ages; and am the more led to believe this
because they always flourish best upon thyme, which grows here as freely
and luxuriantly as I ever elsewhere observed it. About four miles from
said Bee Hall, the other day, I was looking over a genteel residence,
and noticing a shady enclosure, asked the gardener what it was for. He
told me, to protect the bees from the sun: it was upon a much larger
scale than we generally now see, indicating that the soil, &amp;c. suit
apiaries. Looking to the frequent mention of <em>honey</em>, and its vast
consumption formerly, as you instance in royal inventories, to which may
be added documents in cathedral archives, &amp;c., is it not remarkable that
we should witness so few memorials of the ancient management of this
interesting insect? I certainly remember one well-built "bee-house," at
the edge of Lord Portsmouth's park, Hurstbourne, Hants, large enough for
a good cottage, now deserted. While on the subject I will solicit
information on a custom well known to those resident in the country,
viz. of making a great noise with a house key, or other small knocker,
against a metal dish or kettle while bees are swarming? Of course
farmers' wives, peasants, &amp;c., who do not reason, adopt this because
their fathers before them did so. It is urged by intelligent naturalists
that it is utterly useless, as bees have no sense of hearing. What does
the clamour mean,&mdash;whence derived?</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "The bun so fashionable, called the <em>Sally Lunn</em>, originated with
   a young woman of that name at Bath, about thirty years ago."
   [This was written in 1826.] "She first cried them in a basket,
   with a white cloth over it, morning and evening. Dalmer, a
   respectable baker and musician, noticed her, bought her business,
   and made a song and set it to music in behalf of Sally Lunn. This
   composition became the street favourite, barrows were made to
   distribute the nice cakes, Dalmer profited thereby and retired,
   and to this day the <em>Sally Lunn Cake</em> claims pre-eminence in all   the cities of England."</p>

<span>'Prentice Pillars&mdash;'Prentice Windows</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 395.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I am
reminded of a similar story connected with the two rose windows in the
transept of the beautiful cathedral of Rouen. They were described to me
by the old Swiss in charge, as the work of two artists, master and
pupil; and he also pointed out the spot where the master killed the
pupil, from jealousy of the splendid production of the <em>north</em> window by
the latter: and, as the <cite>Guide Book</cite><a id="Page_499"></a> <span class="pagenum">[499]</span> truly says, "La rose du
nord est plus belle que celle du midi"&mdash;the master's work.</p>

<span>Family Likenesses</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 7.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Any one who mixed in the society
of the Scottish metropolis a few years ago must have met with two very
handsome and accomplished brothers, who generally wore the Highland
dress, and were known by the name of "The Princes." I do not mean to
enter into the question as to whether or not they were the true
representatives of "Bonnie Prince Charlie," which most persons consider
to have been conclusively settled in the negative by an article which
appeared in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>: but most assuredly a very strong
point of evidence in favour of their having the royal blood of Scotland
in their veins, was the remarkable resemblance which they
bore&mdash;especially the younger brother&mdash;to various portraits of the Stuart
family, and, among the rest, to those of the "Merry Monarch," as well as
of his father Charles I.</p>

<span>Exeter Controversy</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 126.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This controversy was one of
the many discussions relating to the Trinity which have engaged the
theological activity of England during the last two hundred years. It
arose in consequence of the imputed Arianism of some Presbyterian
ministers of Exeter, the most conspicuous of whom were James Peirce and
Joseph Hallet. It began in 1717, and terminated in 1719, when these two
ministers were ejected from their pulpits. Your correspondent who put
the question will find some account of this controversy in Murch's
<cite>History of the Presbyterian Churches in the West of England</cite>,&mdash;a work
well worth the attention of those who take interest in the antiquities
of Non-conformity.</p>

<h4>
<span>Corrupted Names of Places</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 375.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;When my father was at
one time engaged in collecting the numbers drawn for the Sussex militia,
he began by calling out for those men who belonged to the hundred of
<em>Mayfield</em>; and though he three times repeated his call, not a single
man came forward. A person standing by suggested that he should say "the
hundred of <em>Mearvel</em>," and give it as broad a twang as possible. He did
so; when <em>nineteen</em> out of <em>twenty-three</em> present answered to the
summons. <em>Hurstmonceaux</em> is commonly pronounced <em>Harsmouncy</em>; and I have
heard <em>Sompting</em> called <em>Summut</em>.</p>

<h4>
<span>Poison</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 394.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Junius, Bailey, and Johnson seem all to
agree that our word <em>poison</em> comes from the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poison</i>. I am
inclined to think, with the two first-mentioned lexicographers, that the
etymon is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="[Greek: posis]">&#960;&#8057;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potio</i>. Junius adds, that "Ita Belgis
venenum dicitur <em>gift</em>, donum;" and it is curious that in Icelandic
<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">eitr</i> means both poison and gift. In the <cite>Antiquitates Celto-Scandicæ</cite>
(p. 13.), I find the following expressions:&mdash;"Sva er sagt, at Froda væri
gefinn banadryckr." "Mixta portioni veneno sublatum e vivis tradunt
Frotonem." Should it not be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potioni</i>, inasmuch as "bana," in Icelandic,
signifies to kill, if I do not err, and "dryckr" is drink? Certainly, in
Anglo-Saxon, "bana" (whence our <em>bane</em>) and "drycian" have similar
significations.</p>

 <p class="right">  C. I. R.</p>

<p>Is there any possible doubt that <em>poison</em> is <em>potion</em>? Menage quotes
Suetonius, that Caligula was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potionatus</i> by his wife. It is a French
word undoubtedly.</p>

<h4>
<span>Vikingr Skotar</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 394.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the <cite>Antiquitates
Celto-Scandicæ</cite> it is stated (p. 5.), that after the death of Guthormr,
and subsequently to the departure of Harald (Harfagr) from the Hebrides,
"Sidan settug i löndin vikingar margir Danir oc Nordmenn. Posthac sedes
ibi occupant piratæ plurimi, Dani æqua ac Normanni." The word
<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">vikingar</i>, the true Icelandic word for pirate, often occurs in the same
saga, but not combined with <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">skotar</i>, though this latter term is
repeated, signifying "the Scotch," and also in composition with
<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">konungr</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<span>(Vol. v., pp. 293. 374.).</span>

<p>&mdash;A complete collection of
local rhymes would certainly be both curious and interesting. Those
cited by Chambers in his amusing work are exclusively Scotch; for a
collection relating to English towns, I would refer your Querist
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> to Grose's <cite>Provincial Glossary</cite>, where, interspersed among the
"Local Proverbs," he will find an extensive gathering of characteristic
rhymes. I conclude with appending a few not to be found in either of
these works:</p>

<h4>
<span>"We three"</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 338.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It may interest your correspondent to
learn that a public-house exists in London with the sign he mentions. It
is situate in Virginia Row, Bethnal Green, is styled "The Three
Loggerheads," and has a signboard ornamented with a couple of busts: one
of somewhat Cæsarian aspect, laureated; the other a formidable-looking
personage with something on his head, probably intended for the dog-skin
helmet of the ancient Greeks,&mdash;but as the style of art strongly reminds
one of that adopted for the figure-heads of ships, I confess my doubts
on the subject. Under each bust appears the distich:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p class="noindent"> <span class="smaller">"WE THREE</span></p>
     <p class="noindent"> <span class="smaller">LOGGERHEADS BE</span>."</p>

</div>

<p>The sign appears a "notability" in the neighbourhood, as I have more
than once in passing seen some apparent new comer set to guess its
meaning; and when he confessed his inability, informed, in language more
forcible than elegant, that he made the third Loggerhead.</p>

<h4>
<span>Burning Fern brings Rain</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 242.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In some parts of
America, but more particularly in the New England States, there was a
popular belief, in former times, that immediately after a large fire in
a town, or of wood in a forest, there would be a "fall of rain." Whether
this opinion exists among the people at present, or whether it was
entertained by John Winthrop, the first governor of the colony of
Massachusetts Bay, and the Pilgrim Fathers, on their landing at
Plymouth, as they most unfortunately did, their superstitious belief in
witchcraft, and some other "strange notions," may be a subject of future
inquiry.</p>

<h4>
<span>Plague Stones</span>
<span> (Vol. v., pp. 226. 374.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have often seen the stone
which G. J. R. G. mentions as "to be seen close to Gresford, in
Denbighshire, about a quarter of a mile from the town, on the road to
Wrexham, under a wide-spreading tree, on an open space, where three
roads meet." It is, I conjecture, the base of a cross. This stone may be
the remnant of the last of a succession of crosses, the first of which
may have given its Welsh name, <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Croes ffordd</i>, the way of the cross, to
the village. There is no tradition of any visitation of the plague at
Gresford; but there is reason to suppose that it once prevailed at
Wrexham, which is about three miles distant. Near that town, and on the
side of a hill near the footpath leading from Wrexham vechan to
Marchwiel Hall, there is a field called <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Bryn y cabanau</i>, the brow of
the cabins; the tradition respecting which is, that, during the
prevalence of the plague in Wrexham, the inhabitants constructed wooden
huts in this place for their temporary residences.</p>

<p>I do not think the "Plague Stone" a mile or two out of Hereford has been
mentioned in the Notes on that subject. If my memory is correct, there
is a good deal of ornament, and it is surrounded by a short flight of
stone steps.</p>

<h4>
<span>Sneezing</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 364.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Having occasion to look at the first
edition of the <cite>Golden Legend</cite>, printed by Caxton, I met with the
following passage, which may perhaps prove interesting to your
correspondent, as showing that the custom of blessing persons when they
sneeze "endured" in the fifteenth century. The institution of the
"Litany the more and the lasse," we are told, was justified,&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "For a right grete and grevous maladye: for as the Romayns had in

<h4>
<span>Abbot of Croyland's Motto</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 395.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">ORBES</span> is quite
correct with regard to the motto of Abbot Wells, which should be
"Benedicite Fontes Domin<em>o</em>." The sentence, "Bless the Wells, O Lord!"
which is placed in so awkward a juxtaposition with it, is really a
distinct motto for the name of Wells, and, so far from being a
translation of the abbot's, is almost an inversion of it; and this
should, as M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">ORBES</span> justly remarks, have had "some editorial notice"
from me.</p>

<p class="right">M. A. L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWER.</span></p>



<h4>
<span>Derivation of the Word "Azores"</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 439.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The group of
islands called the <em>Azores</em>, first discovered in 1439, by Joshua
Vanderburg, a merchant of Bruges, and taken possession of by the
Portuguese in 1448, were so named by Martin Behem, from the Portuguese
word <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Açor</i>, a hawk; Behem observing a great number of hawks there. The
three species most frequently seen now are the Kestril, called
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Francelho</i>; the Sparrowhawk, <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Furobardo</i>; and the
 Buzzard, <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Manta</i>; but
whether very numerous or not, I am unable to state. From the
geographical position of these islands, correct lists of the birds and
fishes would be of great interest, and, as far as I am aware, are yet
wanting.</p>

<p>Martin Behem found one of these islands covered with beech-trees, and
called it therefore <em>Fayal</em>, from the Portuguese word <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Faya</i>, a
beech-tree. Another island, abounding in sweet flowers, he called
<em>Flores</em>, from the Portuguese, <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Flor</i>, a flower. <em>Terceira</em>, one of the
nine islands forming the group, is said to have been so called, because,
in the order of succession, it was the third island discovered (from
<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Ter</i> and <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">ceira</i>, a bank). <em>Graciosa</em>, as a name, was conferred upon
one of peculiar beauty, a sort of paradise. <em>Pico</em> derived its name from
its sugar-loaf form. The raven found at Madeira and the Canary Islands
is probably also a native of the Azores, and might have suggested the
Portuguese name of <em>Corvo</em> for one of the nine. St. Mary, St. Michael,
and St. George complete the names of the group, of which St. Michael is
the largest and Corvo the smallest.</p>

<h4>
<span>Scologlandis and Scologi</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 416.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As these names occur in
a Celtic country, we are justified in seeking their explanation in the
Celtic language. I therefore write to inform G. J. R. G. that the word
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">scolog</i> is a living word in the Irish language, and that it signifies a
<em>farmer</em> or <em>husbandman</em>. It is the word used in the Irish Bible at
Matt. xxi. 33., "he let it out to <em>husbandmen</em>"&mdash;tug se do <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">scologaibh</i>
ar chios i.</p>

<p>I may also mention that the name <em>Mac Scoloige</em> is very common in the
co. Fermanagh in Ireland, where it is very generally anglicised
<em>Farmer</em>, according to a usual practice of the Irish. Thus it is not
uncommon even now to find a man known by the name of John or Thomas
<em>Farmer</em>, whose father or grandfather is John or Thomas Mac Scoloige,
the name Mac Scoloige signifying "son of a farmer."</p>

<p>The <em>Scologlandis</em>, in the documents quoted by G. J. R. G., must
therefore have taken their name from the <em>scologs</em> or farmers, by whom
they were cultivated, unless we suppose that they were anciently the
patrimony of some branch of the family of Mac Scoloige, whose remains
are now settled in Fermanagh.</p>

<p>In Scotland the word is now usually written <em>sgalag</em>, and is explained
by Armstrong in his <cite>Gaelic Dictionary</cite> "a farm servant." And the word
does certainly seem to have been used in ancient Irish to denote a
<em>servant</em> or menial attendant, although the notion of a <em>farm</em> servant
seems to have grown out of its other significations. Thus in a very
ancient historical romance (probably as old as the ninth or tenth
century), which is preserved in the curious volume called <cite>Leabhar
breac</cite>, or <cite>Speckled Book</cite>, in the library of the Royal Irish Academy,
the word <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">scolog</i> is used to designate <em>the servant</em> of the Abbot of St.
Finbar's, Cork.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>If there be any one class of documents from which, more than from any
other, we may hope to draw evidence of the accuracy of Byron's
assertion, that "Truth is strange, stranger than fiction!" they are
surely the records of judicial proceedings both in civil and criminal
matters; while, as Mr. Burton well observes in the preface to the two
volumes which have called forth this remark, <cite>Narratives from Criminal
Trials in Scotland</cite>, "there can be no source of information more
fruitful in incidents which have the attraction of picturesqueness,
along with the usefulness of truth." In submitting therefore to the
public the materials of this nature&mdash;some drawn from manuscript
authorities, some again from those works which, being printed for
Subscription Clubs, may be considered as privately printed, and
inaccessible to the majority of readers&mdash;which had accumulated on his
hands while in the pursuit of other inquiries connected with the history
of Scotland, Mr.<a id="Page_502"></a> <span class="pagenum">[502]</span> Burton has produced two volumes which will be
read with the deepest interest. The narratives are of the most varied
character; and while some give us strange glimpses of the workings of
the human heart, and show us how truly the Prophet spoke when he
described it as being "deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked;" and some exhibit humiliating pictures of the fallibility of
human judgment, others derive their chief interest from revealing
collaterally "the social secrets of the day,&mdash;from the state mysteries,
guarded by the etiquette and policy of courts, down to those
characteristics of humble life which are removed from ordinary notice by
their native obscurity." Greater dramatic power on the part of Mr.
Burton might have given additional attraction to his narratives; but
though the want of this power is obvious, they form two volumes which
will be perused with great curiosity and interest even by the most
passionless of readers.</p>

<p>Speaking of the use of Records reminds us that our valued cotemporary
<cite>The Athenæum</cite> has anticipated us in a purpose we have long entertained,
of calling the attention of historical inquirers to the vast amount of
new material for illustrating English history to be found in Sir F.
Palgrave's <cite>Calendar of the "Baga de Secretis,"</cite> printed by him in
several of his Reports, as Deputy Keeper of the Records. As <cite>The
Athenæum</cite> has however entered upon the subject, we cannot do better than
refer our readers to its columns.</p>

<p><cite>Letter addressed to Lord Viscount Mahon, M.P., President of the Society
of Antiquaries, on the Propriety of Reconsidering the Resolutions of
that Society which regulate the Payments from the Fellows</cite>: by John
Bruce, Esq., Treas. S.A.&mdash;is the title of a temperate and well-argued
endeavour on the part of the Treasurer, to persuade the Society of
Antiquaries to return to that scale of subscription, &amp;c. which prevailed
at the moment when unquestionably the Society was at its highest point
of reputation and usefulness. Originally addressed to the President, and
then communicated to the Council, it has now been submitted to the
Fellows, that they may see some of the grounds on which the Council have
recommended, and on which they are invited to ballot on Thursday next,
in favour of a reversal of the Resolution of 1807. Looking to the
general state and prosperity of the Society as exhibited in this
pamphlet, and comparing the payments to it with those to the numerous
Archæological Societies which have sprung up of late years, the proposal
seems to be well-timed, and deserving to be adopted by the Fellows as
obviously calculated to extend the usefulness and raise the character of
the Society. We hope that when the ballot is taken, some of those old
friends of the Society to whose former exertions, in connexion with its
financial arrangements, the Society owes so much, and who are understood
<em>now</em> to be doubtful as to the measure, will put in their white balls in
favour of a step which ought clearly to lead to increased exertions on
the part of all persons connected with the Society; and which may well
be advocated on the ground, that it must lead to such a result.</p>

<p>The lovers of elaborate and highly finished drawings of antiquarian
objects are recommended to inspect some specimens of Mr. Shaw's artistic
skill, comprising portraits of Mary Queen of Scots, Mary of England, the
Pall of the Fishmongers' Company, which will be on view to-day and
Monday at Sotheby and Wilkinson's Rooms, previous to their sale by
auction on Tuesday next.</p>

<p>Although some few examples of the original designs, and many separate
patterns taken from the scattered remains of these most interesting
Pavements, are figured in divers Architectural and Archæological
Publications; it is presumed, that if a series of specimens of the many
varieties of general arrangement to be found in those still existing,
together with a selection of the particular Tiles of each period, the
most remarkable for the elegance and beauty of the foliage and other
devices impressed upon them, were classed chronologically, and brought
within the compass of a single volume, it would prove highly valuable as
a work of reference; not only to architects, but to all who are engaged
in furnishing designs for any kind of material where symmetrical
arrangements or tasteful diaperings are required.</p>

<p>The present work is intended to supply such a desideratum. It will be
completed in Ten Monthly Parts. Each Part to contain Five Plates, royal
